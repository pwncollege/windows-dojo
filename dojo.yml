    Learning to work in a new operating system is like learning to walk for the first time again.  Start your journey by revisiting early concepts in a new guise.

        To get started:
          - Launch the challenge and enter the normal linux environment.
          - Use the `windows` command in the linux environment to `start`, `stop`, or `connect` to a Windows virtual machine.  The VM may take a few moments to start.
          - The Windows desktop gui is accessible over the web at [https://pwn.college/workspace/desktop-windows](https://pwn.college/workspace/desktop-windows).

        Obtaining the flag:
          - The challenge is located in `C:\challenge\`
          - The flag is located at C:\flag, but the hacker user cannot access it, even from the challenge binary!
          - The flag can be accessed by a "flag service" running on the windows machine.
          - The "flag service" will communicate the flag over a pipe located at `\\.\pipe\LOCAL\FlagPipe`.
          - The "flag service" will only communicate the flag to the challenge binary located at `C:\challenge\`.

        Other details:
          - Starting the VM from a practice environment will grant you administrator privileges on the windows machine.  You may need to "log out" and "log in" again before the windows environment acknowledges this.
          - Your linux home directory is accessible via the Windows Z drive.  It is recommended to use this to transfer files between the two environments rather than relying on the Z drive directly.
          - The challenge binary is located at `C:\challenge` in Windows and /challenge in Linux.
          - DO NOT RUN THE CHALLENGE FILE LOCATED AT `Y:`.  This binary cannot obtain the flag and is an implementation detail.

        Use the windows VM in practice mode to leverage the installed tools and develop your exploit.

        In order to obtain the flag, run your exploit **inside the windows environment** targeting challenge binary located in `C:\challenge\`.

  name: Injection and Hijacking
  description: |
      While Windows has many concepts familiar to those seen in Windows, the win32 API and windows security model is quite different and allows for scenarios uncommon in Linux.  This module will explore some classic Windows injection and hijacking techniques that allow code to be executed in the context of another process, such as DLL injection, process hollowing, and thread hijacking.  As an added twist, a rudimentary Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) system will be used to detect and block these techniques.  Can you bypass the EDR and execute your code in the context of another process?
