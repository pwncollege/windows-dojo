    Learning to work in a new operating system is like learning to walk for the first time again.  Start your journey by revisiting early concepts in a new guise.

    Note: This dojo is *slowly* being developed, including iterating on infrastructure support.  Functionality is subject to change!

    THIS DOJO IS CURRENTLY NOT WORKING AS INTENDED.  This will be resolved soon.

        To get started:
          - Launch the challenge and enter the normal linux environment.
          - The windows VM should autostart, this may take a moment
          - You can manually control the windows vm with the `windows` command, ex: `start`, `stop`, or `connect` similar to the linux `vm` command
          - The Windows desktop gui is accessible over the web at [https://pwn.college/workspace/desktop-windows](https://pwn.college/workspace/desktop-windows).
        Other details:
          - Starting the VM from a practice environment will grant you administrator privileges on the windows machine.  You may need to "log out" and "log in" again before the windows environment acknowledges this.
          - The flag is located at C:\flag.
          - Your linux home directory is accessible via the Windows Z drive .
          - The challenge binary is located on the Y drive in Windows and /challenge in Linux.

        Use the windows VM in practice mode to leverage the installed tools and develop your exploit.

        In order to obtain the flag, run your exploit **FROM THE LINUX ENVIRONMENT** targeting tcp port 4001.
        There is a proxy service running inside the windows VM with elevated permissions.
